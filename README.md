# Bullet-Time
✏️ Bullet journaling in the command line

## Compiling
### Requirements
- CMake 3.9
- Linux

You can install all of these on arch linux as:
```
yay -S cmake
```
## Using This Thing
```
bullet new - Make a new bullet
bullet list - List today's bullets
bullet list <FILE> (fmt. YYYY-MM-DD-notes) - List any previous bullets file
```

I want to add git persistence to this and just encrypt all of the journal pages as they push to git so no one can read your shit. Depends on if time is available.
